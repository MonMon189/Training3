Ten Hag expanded on Rashford's recovery regime, after our 28-goal forward missed the first leg and the win over Nottingham Forest following the groin injury he suffered against Everton. Rashford trained with the rest of the group at Carrington on Wednesday morning, before the flight to Spain, but has also been working at our training ground on an individual basis. -He had one session with the team, but he had some sessions before individually,- Erik confirmed.‹separate›Scott McTominay has remained in the UK. as he works on his own recovery, while Alejandro Garnacho, Torn Heaton and Donny van de Beek are all still injured.
